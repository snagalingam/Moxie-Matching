Her current MD does not know about the request to switch so I wanted to ask how that communication works first. Here is a list of requests if possible for new MD - 
Aesthetics LabDrs preferences: 
-Some experience in aesthetics 
-Able to teach some things on how to run some of this. I am still newish so I would like to learn if possible.
-Dedicated to monthly meetings etc. (Our MD now said ""I have a full time job too"" so he didn't have time for my ""emergencies"")
